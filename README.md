So I made the classic Mastermind game with just one small twist - the game is written in <b>assembly language</b>

</p>

<h2 align="center">Description:</h2>
<p align="center">The code is written in EMU8086 emulator software in assembly language
<br/>
<br/>
  - You can find the <a href="https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Mastermind/blob/main/mastermind.asm">code file</a> right here.
<br/>
  - And if you just want to run the <a href="https://github.com/itsikshteinberger/Mastermind/blob/main/mastermind.exe">exe file</a>, it is also here.
<br/>
<br/>
  The code is written in a fairly understandable way in my opinion, and there are comments on almost every line including detailed explanations of the functions in the code file.
<br/>
<br/>
 You can run the code on your emulator (I used <a href="https://emu8086.en.lo4d.com/windows#:~:text=Emu8086%20is%20a%20shareware%20microprocessor,available%20by%20EMU8086%20for%20Windows.&text=Emulator%20runs%20programs%20on%20a,memory%20and%20input%2Foutput%20devices.">emu8086</a>)
